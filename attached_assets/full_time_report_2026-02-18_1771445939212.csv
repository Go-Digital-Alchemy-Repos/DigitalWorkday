And please let me know why this happened.
2) a)Remove top border from this module - or if it's useful in some locations, add a toggle in the module. As you can see, it doesn't work in the location (bottom of page) here: https://sbaprolifedev.wpenginepowered.com/issues/abortion-drugs
	b) Move author/date up immediately under headline, but keep boxes equal height
3) Give each accordion a section ID and if user goes to https://sbaprolifedev.wpenginepowered.com/polling#late-abortions, page should scroll to appropriate accordion and open it
4) Three column boxes module - doesn't have background color option
5) On mobile only: Change red ""Pregnant?"" button so that it is no longer sticky on the right side of the screen. Instead, change it to blue, and move it to the left of the red ""Donate"" button at the top. Please keep everything else about the side panel menu the same.
6) Can we inject the section ID value into the name of a layout item when it is compressed? This would make it much easier to navigate a page backend when layouts are compressed. So, instead of: Two Column Content It would look like: Two Column Content - SECTION_VALUE (And please ensure this change doesn't disappear when ACF is updated)","internal"

2) On mobile, on the home page, the service boxes - After the 3rd service box the spacing below it is larger than the rest.  This is because those boxes are grouped in 3 and the group has spacing to make them appear correctly on desktop but on mobile it creates extra space.  Can you please try to correct that?","internal"

I tried via the settings, but it doesn't seem to 
	be putting it into effect. We don't want the map on this page, as it becomes confusing with the above map.    Could this display the markets for the week, in a 
	list, or by day, view? Again, no map.  Thanks!
	5.Please update this sitewide footer. Correct the ""FoodBanK"" to ""FoodBank"".    and then use the correct EIN ""58-1514800""
	6.In general, sitewide, I believe these pods have some kind of opacity on them, darkening the photos. Since the text pops up with a background, 
	can we please remove that darkening on these pods, sitewide?
	7.Please add instagram. https://www.instagram.com/manna_foodbank
	8.Same thing here, Mike. 25, 100, 250
	9.please increase font 
	10.Add link button to advocacy page 
	11.I would like to have a subscribe option on every page. Maybe this need to be included in the site-wide footer?

Please update footer. It should be organized exactly as the pages in the main nav. 

Nav bar:
Under ""Get Involved"", make ""Become a mentor"" title case

Change ""Giving"" link  to ""Support"" (client asked for this change) and move after ""Get Involved""

When in Stewardship page, the green navigation bar should still be present similar to other pages in ""Ministry Service""

All buttons make 4pt rounded corners - moving to square shape:
Buttons- “Older Posts” button in “Whole Life Mentoring” and “News” should have 4px corners

“Submit” button in Ministry Service should have 4px corners
“Enter” button in “International Mentor Group Application” should have 4px corners
“Send” button in “Become a Mentor” and “Contact” should have 4px corners. 

Search under “Sunday Extra” has 6px rounded corners. And Search in “Whole Life Mentoring”, “News”, and “Blog” has 0px corner rounding. Make it all 4 for consistency. 

“BROWSE EPISODES NOW” under Podcast is all caps. Make it Title case.
“SIGN UP NOW” button in all CTA newsletter sections are all caps. Make it Title case for consistency.


Mobile Version Revisions:
Video in ""Ministry Consulting"", make spaces smaller
In LFM Articles, the cards are all showing too small. Make it take up the space. 
When in Mobile version, the images that has text underneath breaks the paragraph. Is there a way to fix this?
Fix search bar in navigation, overlapping the nav pages. Try to fix it at the bottom
In Mobile version, the green dropdown always show ""Transforming Church Cohorts"" as default. Please fix.

Add space on the right side of the cards when in mobile.
Here also: 

On the pages with sidebar, the last category has less padding than the others. Make consistent. 
Example of category with less bottom padding - Spiritual Vitality, Self Regulation
This one still needs fixing. The arrow on the Select month in Sunday Extra page. 

Submit version in Ministry Consulting looks different. Make the top and bottom padding like other buttons 

Big space in Video Library when scrolling. Please fix

The buttons under ""Thriving Ministry Services"" are not aligned. Please align it. 

Make Leadership Team to Our Staff in order.

I think the hero was deleted.. 

Video beside the LFM difference became too small. Revert it back to its original size.

Please remove ""Latest Video"" header on the first section after the hero. 

Giving Page:
change orange H1 text to all white

In Who We Are and What We Do sections, ""Our Purpose"" and ""Investing in Healthy Leadership"" looks a bit too big compared to other icons. Please make them 25% to 30% smaller by adding padding around it. 

What we do Section - cards are to tall  remove 50% spacing between text and button. Aplly the same height to the ""who We are section""

remove animation from the ""who we are"" section

Change ""Support' to ""About Giving"" (we changed our mind on this terminology) and it should be just a link to the single giving page, not a dropdown.

Housing Attainability button does not work. (Under Policy and Law dropdown > Housing Attainability)

Our Members page missing from the dropdown under Member Development

When the navigation menu is open while in a smaller window, then you resize to a bigger window, it will leave the items of the menu stuck on the side.

On the mobile version, the white container of the logo extends beyond the navigation bar.

Image and text  of slider not centered when9 in mobile version
When in mobile version, the image and text is not centered. I think it has something to do with the old images not being centered?
Instead of a whole image,  please break down the slider into image and a text below it. For initial version please use the images below and use the same text as the one from the original sliders. The background should still be a transparent green. ","internal"

Once all the edits are done, link the ""impact"" main nav menu item and all other dropdown items to correct pages
For Main Navigation Menu, make ""Impact"" Button clickable and linked to new main impact page. All dropdown items will go to the new individual pages. 

When in MOBILE VERSION, no more dropdown for the impact buttons
When in Mobile version, the dropdown buttons will just be buttons that go to their individual pages. They should not act as dropdowns.

Remove overview buttons for all dropdown menus
Remove all overview buttons for all dropdown menus. Instead, make the 4 main rectangle buttons clickable (Policy & Law, Political Leadership, etc.). Each should go to their individual pages.

Please fix all dropdown menus while on the impact page. All dropdown should look like this:
Please also fix for Mobile version. When the nav buttons are clicked, they still go to the old impact pages.

Container is clipping the text on the hero section when in mobile version.
Please fix for all impact pages. Text is cut-off.

Changes to the Impact Buttons:
""Policy Law"" should stay as POLICY AND LAW
Also, the order should be, Membership Development should be last, Regional Impact is the 3rd.
Kindly correct the Membership Dropdown also, all should remain white while on the Membership page. The only one that should be green is the main ""Membership"" nav item

Election Report submenu:
We decided we do not want the ""choose report"" section immediately under hero on election report pages.
I added the following CSS here: .choose-report-year { display:none; }
Once you have removed this div from the template, please remove this CSS.
Instead of ""choose report"" we will display the Submenu VCP menu under hero.
However, now the floating ""sidebar links"" section is slightly hidden by the submenu - see example as you scroll down here - please adjust so it sits below it.

submenu dropdown:
Please add styles for this - see example of what it currently looks like: https://sbaprolifedev.wpenginepowered.com/voter-contact-program-2

image captions:
Please style image captions - font should be smaller (about 70% of body <p>) and grey color

ABout:
Founder section- image is fixed as text scrolls next to it.

Hero: Hero banners site wide - see figma file have fixed height- don't fill view port

Ministry Service pages:
reduce spacing by 50% between image and text

All buttons - reduce spacing between label And arrow to 8px

Double check all H1 & H2, and other header font sizes - are smaller by 10px or more when at the 1366 desktop size

Font Sizing/desktop size?:
what desktop size did you design at? I'm viewing in 1366 and the fonts are still small. and too much spacing between text(see example above)
homepage carousel is to large when I view at 1366 

Paralax Section: 
not the parallax effect animation. I was just using that to describe the section. But how the images behind the content boxes should expand like they do on the Gilbert & Burke site when the desktop window expands or shrinks.

Footer:
Add actual social media links shown from live site https://www.tandemspirituality.com/ (open in new tab)

""Begin Your Journey"" buttons link to contact page

Podcast:
Add real content and links shown here https://tandemspiritua.wpenginepowered.com/podcast/. Is there a way to upload all? If not, add the last 4 and we will work with Kandi to rework the ""Load More Episodes"" button.","internal"

	i) Crop photo from center so buildings show not just sky. I also see a blue line.
	ii) Richard Blais photo pixelated

b) Services:
	i) Lets make container close on the second click. So one click to completely open and a second to take it back to the starting position.
	ii) Some of them jump when clicking open so that it skips a good portion of the text. Need to open at top and user can scroll through to read.	

c) Elevate:
	i) The Pointe Palo Alto photo pixelated
	ii) After watching the video when navigating back to the Elevate page the video plays in the background of the hero

	Reply: I downloaded the “Pointe Palo Alto” photo using an online YouTube image downloader, as a high-quality version was not available. I’ve slightly enhanced the image quality using an online image enhancement tool. Please review and let me know your feedback.

	As per the XD design, this page’s hero section uses a seamlessly looping video background, and I used the same video for both the hero and the bottom section. I’ve now updated the hero video. Kindly review the change and share your thoughts.	


d) About:
	i) Trim 25% of sky from top of photo
	ii) On bios need READ MORE to move so not conflicting when text expanded
	iii) Names cut off on left side

e) Responsible Investing:

	i) Slow down scroll slightly (same speed as Corporate Giving)

c) Featured News: Frames are different size: Update image containers so all images use the same fixed dimensions and aspect ratio. 

d) Featured News: Image hover zoom missing: Apply a subtle hover zoom (scale) effect to images, but keep the frame ration intact.

e) Featured News: This is an addition: Include the following blurb to our news section and have the button “Explore Our Newsroom” link to the news page: “A closer look at recent announcements, milestones, and media coverage from across our portfolio.”

There are several reasons for this, which I’ve outlined below:

1) Staging Site Created Earlier: We cloned the live site to staging around the beginning of 2025. Several pages listed in your report were published on the live site after that time, so they are not present in the staging site.
Examples: https://sunstoppers.com/car-services/automotive-window-tinting-keller/
            https://sunstoppers.com/car-services/automotive-window-tinting-tucson/
            https://sunstoppers.com/car-services/automotive-window-tinting-charlotte/ etc..

2) Pages Merged in the New Design: In the new design, some pages were merged into a single page. As a result, the secondary page URLs no longer exist on staging. These should be resolved by implementing proper redirects.  

3) URL Structure Changes: While we initially maintained the previous URL structure, there were earlier Asana tasks requesting updates to the URL structure. 

   Example:
   Old URL: https://sunstoppers.com/home-services/security-film/
   New URL: https://new.sunstoppers.com/home-office/security-film/ 

   As you can see, the parent slug has changed from “home-services” to “home-office”, which affects the URL path.

 4) The SEO team updated several page names and slugs for optimization purposes, but the menu links were not updated accordingly. As previously mentioned in Asana, the “Tesla Ceramic Coating” and “Tesla Model 3” pages were renamed, but the menu still links to the old URLs, resulting in 404 errors.
 
 5) There are multiple blog posts currently live that were published after the staging site was created. These posts are not yet present in staging and will need to be migrated.","internal"
