You are continuing development on my existing single-codebase React + Express app. DO NOT rewrite the app. Implement ONLY the Time Tracking “Edit Timed Entry” refinements described below. Preserve all existing functionality (Clients→Projects→Tasks/Subtasks, timers/manual entries, attachments, sockets, Admin settings, My Tasks, etc.).

===============================================================================
ABSOLUTE SAFETY RULES (READ FIRST)
===============================================================================
- NO major refactors, no folder restructures, no framework swaps.
- Do NOT remove/rename any endpoints or tables.
- Schema changes must be ADD-ONLY and backward compatible (nullable + safe defaults).
- Only touch Time Tracking UI + the time entry update/delete endpoints.
- Do NOT change timer logic (start/pause/resume/stop) except as needed to support editing existing entries after creation.
- If realtime events are emitted, ALL emits MUST go through /server/src/realtime/events.ts.

===============================================================================
GOAL
===============================================================================
After a timed entry is created (from stopwatch), a Team Member must be able to:
- click an “Edit” action on the time entry row/card
- open an edit panel
- modify ALL fields of the entry
- save changes with validation
- delete the entry from the same edit menu (or row actions)

This must apply to BOTH:
- timer-created entries (source="timer")
- manual entries

===============================================================================
1) UI CHANGES (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================

A) Time Entries list/table row actions
- For each time entry row/card, add an “Edit” action.
- Existing “Delete” action should remain available.
- Prefer a compact actions menu (⋯) with:
  - Edit
  - Delete

B) Edit panel (slide-out, NOT modal)
On Edit click, open a slide-out panel that allows editing ALL time entry fields:
- Title
- Client (dropdown)
- Project (dropdown filtered by client)
- Task (dropdown filtered by project; open tasks by default)
- If selected task has subtasks: show Sub-task dropdown
  - If subtask selected: save taskId = subtaskId
- Entry Date
- Time input:
  - Start time + End time OR
  - Duration (hh:mm or minutes)
- Description/Notes
- Scope (in_scope / out_of_scope) if present
- Billable toggle / rate if present

Important cascading behavior:
- Changing Client resets Project/Task/Sub-task.
- Changing Project refetches tasks and resets Task/Sub-task.
- Changing Task shows/hides Sub-task dropdown.

C) Edit panel actions
- “Save changes”
- “Delete entry” (with confirmation dialog)
- “Cancel”

UX requirements:
- Show current values pre-filled.
- Validate required fields (client, project, task, date, duration or start/end).
- Show errors inline.
- Show success toast after save.

===============================================================================
2) BACKEND SUPPORT (BACKWARD COMPATIBLE)
===============================================================================

A) Ensure PATCH /api/v1/time-entries/:id supports editing ALL fields
If already implemented, verify it supports these updates:
- title
- clientId
- projectId
- taskId
- entryDate
- startAt / endAt
- durationMinutes
- description
- scope
- isBillable / hourlyRateCents (if used)

Validation rules (MANDATORY):
- projectId must belong to clientId
- taskId must belong to projectId
- durationMinutes must be recomputed server-side when startAt/endAt provided
- durationMinutes must be > 0
- If both durationMinutes and start/end are provided, choose a canonical rule (recommended):
  - compute from start/end and ignore duration input OR reject and ask user to choose one

Permissions:
- Employee can edit/delete their own entries
- Admin can edit/delete any entries
- Client users should not have access unless already supported (do not add client access in this prompt)

B) DELETE /api/v1/time-entries/:id
- Ensure delete works from edit panel
- Prefer soft delete if already used

===============================================================================
3) REALTIME (RECOMMENDED)
===============================================================================
If your app uses sockets:
- Emit via /server/src/realtime/events.ts ONLY:
  - timeEntry:updated
  - timeEntry:deleted
Payload must include:
- entry id and updated fields so UI can patch without refetch

Frontend should update lists/totals immediately in other tabs/windows.

===============================================================================
4) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST WORK)
===============================================================================
1) Each time entry row has an Edit action (and Delete either inline or in menu)
2) Edit panel opens with all fields prefilled
3) User can edit ALL fields of a time entry and save successfully
4) Cascading dropdowns work:
   - project change reloads tasks
   - task change shows/hides subtasks
   - subtask selection saves correctly (taskId=subtaskId)
5) Delete from edit panel works with confirmation
6) Validation prevents invalid combinations (task not in project, etc.)
7) Existing timers and time entry creation flows continue to work unchanged

===============================================================================
5) OUTPUT REQUIRED
===============================================================================
When done, output:
- Summary of changes
- Files modified
- Any endpoint adjustments (no breaking changes)
- Manual test steps for acceptance criteria 1–7
