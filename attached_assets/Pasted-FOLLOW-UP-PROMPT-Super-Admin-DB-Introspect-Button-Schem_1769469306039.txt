FOLLOW-UP PROMPT: Super Admin “DB Introspect” Button + Schema Drift Report (Safe)

You are continuing development on my React + Express + Postgres multi-tenant app using Drizzle.
We already have (or just added) a read-only db introspection script/report. Now add a Super Admin UI tool
to run/view the schema drift report from inside the app.

SAFETY RULES
- READ-ONLY DB queries only (no writes, no migrations, no schema changes).
- Super Admin ONLY access.
- Do NOT expose secrets (DB URL, credentials, API keys).
- Do NOT change any existing endpoint paths or response shapes (add-only endpoint is OK).
- Keep output concise (tables/columns presence), avoid returning full DDL.

FEATURE REQUIREMENTS
A) Add a Super Admin endpoint (add-only)
- GET /api/v1/super/system/db-introspect
Returns JSON:
{
  "generatedAt": "...",
  "database": { "hostHint": "railway-postgres", "nameHint": "...(masked)..." },
  "tables": [
     { "name": "notifications", "exists": true, "columns": ["id","user_id","tenant_id", ...] },
     { "name": "notification_preferences", "exists": false, "columns": [] },
     ...
  ],
  "requiredChecks": [
     { "check": "notifications.tenant_id exists", "ok": true },
     { "check": "notification_preferences table exists", "ok": false },
     { "check": "tenant_settings.chat_retention_days exists", "ok": false }
  ]
}

Implementation notes:
- Use information_schema queries (read-only).
- Mask DB identifying info (only hints).
- If MAINTENANCE_TOOLS=false (or env flag you use), return 404/403 safely.

B) Add Super Admin UI in System Status
- New tab (or section) called “DB Introspect”
- Button: “Run DB Introspect”
- Shows:
  - generatedAt timestamp
  - Required checks list with pass/fail indicators
  - Tables list with exists + key columns
- Add “Copy JSON” button
- Add “Download JSON” button (client-side download)

C) Link it to Tenant Health & Error Log workflows
- If requiredChecks fail, show a banner:
  “Schema drift detected — migrations may be missing in production.”
- Provide quick links:
  - “Open Error Log”
  - “Open Tenant Health & Repair”

TESTS (MINIMUM)
- db_introspect_super_admin_only.test.ts
- db_introspect_read_only_queries.test.ts (verify only SELECTs used, no writes)
- db_introspect_flag_disabled_blocks_access.test.ts

DOCS
- /docs/PROD_SCHEMA_REPORT.md:
  - endpoint usage
  - how to interpret required checks
  - recommended next steps when failures found

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Super Admin can run/view schema drift report from UI on Railway.
- Report does not expose secrets.
- Endpoint is super-admin only and can be disabled via env flag.
- No schema changes and no side effects.
OUTPUT
- Endpoint implementation file path
- UI component path
- Env flags used
- Screenshot/description of where it appears in System Status
