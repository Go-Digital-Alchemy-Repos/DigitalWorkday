You are continuing development on my React + Express + Postgres (Drizzle) multi-tenant app (single codebase) deployed on Railway.

TASK: Add a Railway Verification Checklist + lightweight deployment verification aids (non-destructive).

ABSOLUTE SAFETY RULES
- Do NOT change any endpoint paths or response shapes.
- Do NOT change auth/tenancy/agreement enforcement behavior.
- Do NOT introduce interactive DB commands (no drizzle-kit push prompts).
- Do NOT wipe data.
- Additive changes only: docs + small read-only endpoints + minimal boot logging.

GOAL
Create a repeatable post-deploy verification process and small diagnostics that make Railway issues easier to debug.

PART 1 — Add Railway Verification Checklist to the repo
1) Create a new file:
   /docs/RAILWAY_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md

2) Populate it with a step-by-step checklist that covers:
   A) Pre-deploy local checks:
      - tests pass
      - build passes
      - confirm no interactive DB push in prod startup
   B) Railway startup checks:
      - service stays running
      - migration runner ran or no pending migrations
      - no interactive schema prompts
   C) Auth sanity:
      - login works on first attempt
      - cookie/session persists after refresh
      - logout works
   D) Super Admin sanity:
      - System Status loads
      - Error Logs tab loads
      - tenant switcher works
      - Act-as-client fully impersonates + return banner works
   E) Tenant core flows:
      - create client
      - create project (client required)
      - create task (no 500)
      - create sub-task
      - assign task and confirm visibility in left nav
   F) Time tracking:
      - start timer (title present)
      - pause/resume
      - save entry with client→project→task(/subtask)
      - edit entry
   G) Notifications (if enabled):
      - endpoints return 200/not configured, not 500
   H) Integrations (super admin):
      - mailgun/s3/stripe save persists after refresh (masked)
      - status endpoint returns configured/not configured
   I) Chat (if enabled):
      - start new chat
      - add members
      - reconnect without duplicates
   J) Error handling + requestId:
      - trigger a validation error; UI shows requestId; requestId exists in super admin error logs

Include a final “If anything fails” section:
- copy requestId
- check Super Admin Error Logs
- check Railway logs around requestId
- revert only the last batch

PART 2 — Add a simple health endpoint (read-only)
Add a read-only endpoint that DOES NOT expose secrets:
- GET /api/health
Return minimal JSON:
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "api",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "version": "<git sha or build id if available>"
}
If the route already exists, do not change its response shape; only add missing fields if safe.

PART 3 — Add a Super Admin-only diagnostics endpoint (read-only)
Add:
- GET /api/v1/super/diagnostics/schema
Super Admin only.
Read-only: returns a report of whether key tables/columns exist (no secrets), for example:
- error_logs table present?
- notification_preferences table present?
- notifications tenantId column present?
- tenant settings chat_retention_days present?
Return counts and boolean presence flags only; do not dump all schema details in production.
If a table/column is missing, include a “recommended action” string (e.g., “run migrations”).

PART 4 — Minimal boot logging for verification
On server startup, log one concise line:
- environment
- whether DB connection succeeded
- whether migration runner ran (if you have a migration step, print “migrations: ok” or “migrations: skipped”)
Do NOT log secrets.

PART 5 — Docs index update
If you have an in-app “App Docs” area or a docs index page, add a link/reference to:
- Railway Verification Checklist
- Schema Diagnostics endpoint (super admin only)
Make this additive and non-breaking.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- /docs/RAILWAY_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md exists and is complete.
- /api/health returns 200 with minimal non-sensitive info.
- /api/v1/super/diagnostics/schema returns 200 for super admins and 403 for others.
- No breaking changes to existing endpoints or response shapes.
- No secrets exposed in logs or diagnostics.
