You are continuing development on my React + Express multi-tenant app (single codebase).
REFINEMENT: Super Admin “Global Reports” → move contents to “Dashboard” and make it the default landing page.

Goal:
- Everything currently inside the Super Admin “Global Reports” tab should be moved into a standalone page called “Dashboard”.
- Super Admins should land on this Dashboard by default after login.
- Remove “Global Reports” from the Super Admin navigation once migrated.

===============================================================================
ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE SAFETY RULES
===============================================================================
- Do NOT change API endpoints or response shapes.
- Do NOT change auth/tenancy/impersonation logic.
- Do NOT remove any reporting functionality; only relocate UI.
- No DB schema changes.
- Avoid large UI redesign; keep visuals similar, just re-home content.
- Ensure the change is reversible and does not break deep links.

===============================================================================
PART A — CREATE SUPER ADMIN DASHBOARD PAGE
===============================================================================
1) Create a new route/page for Super Admin:
- Route: /super/dashboard
- Navigation item label: “Dashboard” (Super Admin menu area)

2) Move all existing Global Reports tab UI/content into this new page:
- Keep the same components and query hooks if possible.
- Preserve filters, charts, and data layout exactly as-is unless minor layout tweaks are needed due to page context.

3) If the Global Reports content is currently embedded inside a Settings tab component:
- Extract the reports UI into a shared component/module:
  - e.g. client/src/features/super/reports/SuperReportsPanel.tsx
- Then render it in /super/dashboard.

===============================================================================
PART B — MAKE DASHBOARD DEFAULT LANDING FOR SUPER ADMINS
===============================================================================
1) After successful login (cookie-based):
- If user.role == "super_user" AND NOT impersonating (effectiveTenantId is null):
  - redirect to /super/dashboard

2) If super admin is impersonating a tenant:
- preserve current behavior (do not force /super/dashboard).

3) Update routing fallback:
- /super should redirect to /super/dashboard
- Any old default super landing route should remain valid but redirect to dashboard.

===============================================================================
PART C — REMOVE “GLOBAL REPORTS” TAB / NAV ITEM SAFELY
===============================================================================
1) Remove the “Global Reports” tab from Super Admin settings UI navigation.
- Do not delete the underlying components yet; they are now used by Dashboard.

2) If any links exist pointing to the old tab route:
- Keep a redirect route (client-side) from the old path to /super/dashboard
- Show a short toast: “Global Reports moved to Dashboard.”

===============================================================================
PART D — CACHE / QUERY KEYS
===============================================================================
- Ensure all query keys used by reports remain super-scoped (no tenantId required).
- If any reports queries were mistakenly tenant-scoped, do not change their behavior here; only ensure they still render.

===============================================================================
TESTS (LIGHTWEIGHT BUT REQUIRED)
===============================================================================
1) super_login_redirects_to_dashboard.test.tsx
- super user logs in => lands on /super/dashboard (not impersonating)

2) dashboard_renders_reports_panel.test.tsx
- confirms reports panel renders on the dashboard

3) global_reports_redirects_to_dashboard.test.tsx
- visiting old Global Reports route redirects to /super/dashboard

If UI test infra is limited, add manual checklist to /docs/REGRESSION_CHECKLIST.md.

===============================================================================
DOCUMENTATION
===============================================================================
- Update /docs/SUPER_ADMIN_GUIDE.md:
  - Dashboard is the landing page
  - Reports are accessed via Dashboard
- Update any navigation screenshots/notes if present.

===============================================================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
===============================================================================
- Super Admins land on /super/dashboard immediately after login.
- Dashboard shows all content previously in Global Reports (no loss).
- “Global Reports” is removed from navigation/settings tabs.
- Old deep links redirect to Dashboard gracefully.
- No backend/API changes, no schema changes, tests pass.

===============================================================================
OUTPUT REQUIRED
===============================================================================
- Which files/components were moved/extracted
- Which old route(s) were redirected
- Manual test checklist (local + Railway)
