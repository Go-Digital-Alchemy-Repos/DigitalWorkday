You are working inside an existing React + Node/Express + Postgres app repo (MyWorkDay). NON-DESTRUCTIVE UPDATE ONLY: do not remove existing features, routes, or pages. Prefer additive refactors with compatibility wrappers.

PHASE A — Create a premium, owned design system
1) Create a Design Tokens system using CSS variables:
   - colors: bg, surface, surfaceElevated, border, text, textMuted, brand, brandHover, danger, success, warning
   - radii: sm, md, lg
   - shadows: sm, md, lg
   - spacing scale + typography ramp
   - motion tokens: duration-1/2/3 and easing standard
   - Put tokens in a single source (e.g. styles/tokens.css or src/styles/tokens.css) and wire it to the app root.

2) Create a shared UI component library folder:
   - src/components/ui (or equivalent)
   - Use Radix UI primitives if already installed; if not installed, add Radix packages minimally (Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tabs, Tooltip, Toast, ScrollArea) and keep styling owned.
   - Use class-variance-authority (CVA) if available; otherwise implement simple variant patterns.

3) Build the minimum “premium UI kit” components (owned styles, consistent spacing, accessible):
   - Button, IconButton
   - Input, Textarea
   - Select/Combobox (basic)
   - Checkbox, Switch
   - Tabs
   - Badge/Tag
   - Tooltip
   - Toast (global)
   - Dialog/Modal
   - Drawer/Sheet (for CRM panels)
   - DropdownMenu
   - Skeleton
   - EmptyState
   Each component must support variants (primary/secondary/ghost/destructive) and sizes (sm/md/lg).

4) Create layout primitives:
   - AppShell, PageHeader, SectionHeader, Card (surface vs elevated)
   - Standardize page padding, max widths, and responsive breakpoints.

PHASE B — Apply UI consistency across the app
5) Identify the most visible surfaces (Nav, top bars, buttons, forms, tables) and refactor them to use the new UI components.
   - Do this incrementally and keep old styling working until each area is migrated.
   - Add a “UI Consistency Checklist” doc in the Docs Library or /docs that explains usage rules (no raw <button>, no raw <input> in app screens, use Skeleton/EmptyState patterns, etc.)

PHASE C — Quality gates
6) Add lint rules or simple conventions to discourage raw HTML controls in feature pages (do not break the build).
7) Ensure Inter (or your chosen app font) is consistently applied across admin + frontend, and all new pages match the existing admin look.

Deliverables:
- tokens.css + wiring
- ui/ component library
- layout primitives
- refactor a handful of key screens to prove the system
- docs describing patterns and how to use them
