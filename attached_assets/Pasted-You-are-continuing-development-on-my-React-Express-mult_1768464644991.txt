You are continuing development on my React + Express multi-tenant app (single codebase).
REFINEMENT: Centralize SaaS Agreement Management under Super Admin System Settings.
Tenant Admins must NOT manage agreements; they only need to VIEW/DOWNLOAD their own signed agreement.

We are moving functionality (UI + wiring) out of Tenant Admin Account Settings and into Super Admin System Settings.
We must preserve agreement gating behavior: Tenant Admins are required to sign on first login (if that’s current policy).

===============================================================================
ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE SAFETY RULES
===============================================================================
- Do NOT change endpoint paths or response shapes (add-only is OK if needed).
- Do NOT change the existing agreement enforcement strategy or bypass rules (Phase 3C hardening stays intact).
- Do NOT change database schema unless absolutely necessary (prefer reusing existing agreements/signatures tables).
- Do NOT delete agreement data (existing agreements and signatures must remain).
- Do NOT remove tenant’s ability to view/download their own signed agreement.
- Any UI removal on tenant side must not break deep links; use redirects if necessary.

===============================================================================
GOALS
===============================================================================
1) Super Admin:
- System Settings gets a new tab: “SaaS Agreements”
- Super Admins can create, edit, publish, version, and assign SaaS agreements to tenants
- Super Admins can view signing status per tenant (signed/pending/version)

2) Tenant Admin:
- Remove SaaS Agreement management from Tenant Admin Account Settings entirely
- Tenant Admin can ONLY:
  - View agreement required for their tenant (read-only)
  - Sign it (if required, on first login / gating)
  - Download/view the signed copy later from a “Billing/Account” or “Legal” read-only section
- Tenant Admin cannot create/edit/publish agreements

===============================================================================
PART A — SUPER ADMIN: SYSTEM SETTINGS → “SaaS Agreements” TAB
===============================================================================
A1) Navigation / UI placement
- Super Admin → System Settings
- Add tab: “SaaS Agreements” (near Integrations/Invoice Settings)

A2) Agreement library + versioning
Provide a list/table of agreement versions:
- Agreement Name
- Version
- Status: Draft / Active / Archived
- CreatedAt / UpdatedAt
- Actions: View/Edit, Publish/Activate, Archive, Duplicate

A3) Agreement editor (full-width drawer, not small modal)
Fields:
- Name (required)
- Version label (auto-increment or manual, but consistent)
- Body content (rich text or markdown; keep simple if current implementation exists)
- Effective date
- Optional: require re-sign on version change (boolean)
- Save Draft
- Publish/Activate (with confirmation)

A4) Tenant assignment controls
Within agreement detail/editor:
- “Applies to”:
  - All tenants (default) OR
  - Selected tenants (multi-select)
- If you already have tenant scoping logic, reuse it; do NOT break it.

A5) Signing status visibility (super admin)
Add a “Tenant Signatures” panel:
- Tenant name
- Required version
- Status: pending/signed
- Signed by (user/email)
- Signed date
- Download signed pdf/record (if supported)

===============================================================================
PART B — TENANT ADMIN: REMOVE MANAGEMENT UI, KEEP VIEW/DOWNLOAD ONLY
===============================================================================
B1) Remove tenant-side agreement management pages/tools
- In Tenant Admin Account Settings area:
  - remove “SaaS Agreements” management UI (create/edit/publish/assign)
  - remove any ability to change agreement configuration
- If tenant UI has an agreement management route:
  - keep route but redirect to a read-only “Your Agreement” view OR show 404 with a friendly message
  - do not break navigation or crash

B2) Tenant Admin “Your Agreement” page (read-only)
Add/keep a tenant-accessible page such as:
- Tenant Settings → Legal (or Account → Legal)
This page must show:
- current required agreement version (if any)
- signed status
- signed date
- signer name/email
- download link (signed doc) OR a print-friendly view
No editing.

B3) First login signing flow (preserve)
- Keep existing agreement enforcement middleware behavior unchanged:
  - if agreement required and not signed => block tenant routes until signed
- Ensure the signing page is accessible even when gated:
  - allow routes needed to view and sign agreement

===============================================================================
PART C — BACKEND WIRING (PREFER REUSE; ADD-ONLY IF NEEDED)
===============================================================================
C1) Reuse existing tables if present
Likely:
- agreements (versions)
- tenant_agreement_requirements or tenant_required_agreement_version
- agreement_signatures

Do NOT drop or rename.

C2) Ensure Super Admin endpoints exist (add-only if missing)
Examples (use your existing patterns; keep consistent):
- GET /api/v1/super/agreements
- POST /api/v1/super/agreements
- PATCH /api/v1/super/agreements/:id
- POST /api/v1/super/agreements/:id/publish
- POST /api/v1/super/agreements/:id/archive
- GET /api/v1/super/agreements/:id/tenants (signing statuses)

C3) Tenant endpoints (read-only)
- GET /api/v1/tenant/agreement
  Returns:
  { requiredAgreementVersion, status, signedAt, signer, downloadUrl? }
- POST /api/v1/tenant/agreement/sign
  Body: { agreementId or versionId, accepted: true }
  Must record signature and then allow access.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT change response shapes if these endpoints already exist; only add missing ones.

===============================================================================
PART D — CACHE INVALIDATION + NAV UPDATES
===============================================================================
- After super admin publishes/updates agreements:
  - invalidate tenant health/readiness caches
  - invalidate any super agreement lists
- Remove tenant nav items that imply agreement management.
- Ensure super admin sees SaaS Agreements in System Settings.

===============================================================================
TESTS (MANDATORY MINIMUM)
===============================================================================
1) super_can_create_publish_agreement.test.ts
- creates draft
- publishes
- appears as active

2) tenant_cannot_access_agreement_admin_endpoints.test.ts
- tenant admin forbidden from super endpoints

3) tenant_can_view_download_own_signed_agreement.test.ts
- tenant can fetch their own agreement summary and download/view

4) agreement_gating_allows_sign_route_when_blocked.test.ts
- tenant blocked from other routes but can access agreement view/sign routes

5) tenant_ui_no_management_controls.test.tsx (if UI tests exist)
- tenant settings does not show create/edit/publish controls

===============================================================================
DOCUMENTATION STANDARD (REQUIRED)
===============================================================================
- Update /docs/SUPER_ADMIN_GUIDE.md:
  - SaaS Agreements management in System Settings
- Update /docs/TENANT_ADMIN_GUIDE.md:
  - Tenant Admin only views/downloads signed agreement
  - Signing required on first login (if applicable)
- Update /docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md with:
  - agreement versioning + assignment + gating

===============================================================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
===============================================================================
- Super Admin can fully manage agreements from System Settings.
- Tenant Admin no longer has agreement management tools anywhere.
- Tenant Admin can still sign on first login and later view/download their signed agreement.
- Existing gating behavior remains intact.
- No endpoint path/response shape changes; no data loss; tests pass.

===============================================================================
OUTPUT REQUIRED
===============================================================================
- Which tenant UI routes/components were removed/redirected
- Where the new Super Admin SaaS Agreements tab lives and what it includes
- Endpoints used/added
- Manual verification checklist (local + Railway)
