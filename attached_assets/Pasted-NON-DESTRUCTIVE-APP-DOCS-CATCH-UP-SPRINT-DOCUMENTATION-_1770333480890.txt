NON-DESTRUCTIVE: APP DOCS “CATCH-UP” SPRINT (DOCUMENTATION ONLY)

GOAL
Update the in-app **Super Admin → App Docs** so it accurately documents all features, routes/APIs, and configuration that have been added or changed since our last documentation sprint.

IMPORTANT: Documentation work ONLY.
- Do NOT modify business logic or UI features (except minor doc formatting within the App Docs area).
- Do NOT refactor code.
- Do NOT change endpoints, database, or behavior.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 1 — ESTABLISH BASELINE & DIFF
1) Identify where App Docs content is stored (DB tables, markdown files, etc.).
2) Identify the date/time or commit hash of the “last documentation sprint” by checking:
   - existing App Docs entries mentioning the sprint
   - recent commits/tags
   - any /docs notes
3) Build a “changes since sprint” inventory by scanning:
   - server routes and controllers/modules
   - migrations/schema changes
   - new UI pages/components
   - new background jobs / cron / queue workers
   - new socket events
   - new env vars/config

Create /docs/APP_DOCS/CHANGELOG_SINCE_LAST_SPRINT.md containing:
- grouped list of changes by area (Chat, Comments/Mentions, Presence/Read Receipts, Theme/Theming, Reports, Admin Tools, etc.)
- links/paths to key files and endpoints involved

Do not write App Docs yet until this changelog exists.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 2 — UPDATE IN-APP APP DOCS (SUPER ADMIN)
For each change group found in the changelog, update App Docs with:
1) Feature overview (what it is, who can access it)
2) UI location(s) and key workflows
3) API endpoints (method + path + purpose)
4) Socket events (if any)
5) Data model notes (tables/columns added, if any)
6) Permissions/RBAC notes (tenant scoping, admin-only, etc.)
7) Edge cases / known limitations
8) “How to test” checklist (manual verification steps)

Required sections to include (if applicable to what was added):
- Chat UX upgrades (Channels + DMs layout)
- Typing indicators
- Presence (online/idle/offline)
- Read receipts + unread counts + jump-to-unread
- Threaded replies
- Mentions standardization (@mentions)
- Rich Text Editor standardization (code block, lists, alignment)
- Theme system (light/dark/system + accent presets)
- Theme migration/token usage guidelines
- Any new Super Admin tools (Chat Data Settings, exports, purge jobs) if implemented

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 3 — API REGISTRY + CONFIG DOCS
1) Update the internal “API Registry” section/page(s) in App Docs:
   - ensure every new/modified endpoint is listed
   - ensure request/response examples (brief) exist where helpful
2) Update “Configuration” docs:
   - new ENV vars
   - storage providers (S3/R2) if used
   - cron/job runner config if used
   - feature flags if used

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 4 — QUALITY BAR
1) App Docs entries must be consistent in structure:
   - Title
   - Summary
   - Roles/Access
   - UI locations
   - API endpoints
   - Socket events
   - Data model
   - Testing checklist
2) Ensure no stale/contradictory docs remain:
   - if old docs reference renamed modules or outdated flows, update them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED
After updating App Docs, provide:
1) A list of App Docs pages added/updated (titles)
2) The changelog doc path created (/docs/APP_DOCS/CHANGELOG_SINCE_LAST_SPRINT.md)
3) A quick “coverage check” summary: which major areas were documented and which were not (if any)
