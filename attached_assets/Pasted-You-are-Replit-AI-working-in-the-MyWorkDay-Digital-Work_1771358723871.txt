GOAL:
Mobile Workflow UX Phase 3A — Make Tasks feel premium and effortless on mobile for both employees and admins.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE RULES:
- Do NOT change backend APIs.
- Do NOT change routes.
- Reuse existing components where possible.
- Keep desktop UI unchanged (or improved, but not broken).

DELIVERABLES:
1) Mobile-friendly Tasks List experience:
   - card/list hybrid layout on <sm screens
   - clear status, due date, assignee, priority visibility
   - tap-friendly row interactions
2) Filters/Search Sheet:
   - move filters into a “Filter” drawer/sheet on mobile
   - include common filters: status, assignee, due range, project/workspace
3) Task Details Mobile Layout:
   - header shows title + key metadata
   - sticky bottom action bar on mobile (Complete, Comment, Assign)
4) Mobile editing patterns:
   - Assign user, set due date, change status uses AppDrawer patterns
5) Verification checklist included in docs/mobile-audit.md Phase 3A section

IMPLEMENTATION:

A) Tasks List (mobile)
- On mobile, render tasks in a compact card row:
  - left: status indicator + title (2 lines max)
  - right: due date + priority chip
  - below: assignee + project/workspace label
- Ensure row is clickable with min-h >= 44px (if acceptable)
- Ensure long titles wrap gracefully.

B) Filters & Search
- Add a top “Search” input (mobile full width).
- Add a “Filters” button that opens AppDrawer with:
  - Status multi-select
  - Assignee select
  - Project select (if applicable)
  - Due date range
  - Clear filters + Apply
- Ensure filters state persists and reflects active filters.

C) Task Detail view (mobile)
- Ensure task detail page:
  - uses PageContainer
  - has readable spacing
  - comments section is not cramped
- Add a sticky bottom action bar on mobile:
  - Complete/Uncomplete
  - Add Comment
  - Quick Assign
- These actions open drawers (not small modals).

D) Assignment and quick edits
- Use AppDrawer for:
  - Assign user
  - Update status
  - Update due date
  - Update priority
- Ensure keyboard-safe layout in drawers.

E) Testing / Verification
- If UI tests exist, add at least 2 tests for:
  - Filters drawer opens and applies state
  - Sticky action bar visible on mobile width
- If no tests, add manual verification steps in docs/mobile-audit.md:
  - tasks list browsing
  - filtering
  - opening task
  - completing task
  - assigning user
  - adding comment

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return:
- files changed
- what mobile breakpoints were used
- what drawers were added
- how to verify quickly
