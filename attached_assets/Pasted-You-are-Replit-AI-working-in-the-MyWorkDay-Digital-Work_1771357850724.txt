You are Replit AI working in the MyWorkDay (Digital Workday) TypeScript monorepo.

GOAL:
Implement a consistent mobile navigation architecture that makes the app feel natural on phones while preserving the existing desktop sidebar layout.

This phase introduces:
- bottom navigation standardization
- sidebar collapse strategy
- mobile workspace switcher
- drawer patterns for navigation and editing
without changing business logic or API behavior.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE RULES:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Do NOT change API calls.
- Do NOT remove desktop sidebar navigation.
- Preserve existing page components.
- Navigation changes should be structural UI improvements only.

DELIVERABLES:
1) Standardized MobileNavBar component behavior.
2) Sidebar collapse model for mobile.
3) Workspace switcher usable on mobile.
4) Drawer-based navigation pattern.
5) No desktop regressions.

IMPLEMENTATION:

A) Bottom Navigation Standardization
Ensure MobileNavBar:
- uses fixed bottom positioning
- has safe-area padding support
- supports 4–5 core destinations:
  - Home/Dashboard
  - Tasks
  - Chat
  - Time
  - Projects (if space allows)
Use icons from lucide-react.

Ensure active route highlighting is clear.

B) Sidebar Collapse Strategy
On mobile:
- Sidebar should not render persistently.
- Sidebar becomes a drawer accessible from header menu button.
- Desktop behavior remains unchanged.

Implement:
MobileSidebarDrawer
that reuses the existing sidebar content.

C) Workspace Switcher (Mobile)
If workspace switching currently exists only in sidebar:
- Add workspace switcher to mobile header.
- Use dropdown or sheet pattern.
- Ensure it is thumb-reachable.

D) Drawer Pattern Standardization
Create a reusable:
AppDrawer
component built with Radix Dialog/Sheet.

Use it for:
- mobile sidebar
- workspace switcher (if needed)
- future edit panels

Ensure:
- smooth animation
- scroll lock
- correct z-index stacking

E) Header Improvements
Ensure mobile header:
- has consistent height
- includes:
  - menu button
  - workspace indicator
  - page title
- does not overflow on small screens.

F) Verification
Verify on mobile viewport:
- Can navigate entire app using bottom nav + drawer.
- Sidebar accessible via drawer.
- Workspace switching works.
- Chat reachable in <= 2 taps.
- Tasks reachable in <= 2 taps.
- Time tracking reachable in <= 2 taps.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
When finished, output:
- files changed
- new navigation components added
- mobile navigation flow description
- any UI risks discovered
