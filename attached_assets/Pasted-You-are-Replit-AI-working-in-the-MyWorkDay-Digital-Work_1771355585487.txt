You are Replit AI working in the MyWorkDay (Digital Workday) TypeScript monorepo.

GOAL:
Begin a Mobile-First UX sprint by auditing and improving the responsive layout foundation across the frontend without changing business logic or API behavior.

This phase focuses on:
- layout consistency
- spacing scale
- container widths
- scroll behavior
- tap targets
- safe mobile defaults

NON-DESTRUCTIVE RULES:
- Do NOT change API calls.
- Do NOT change routes.
- Do NOT change component behavior logic.
- Do NOT remove desktop functionality.
- Changes should be CSS/layout/system-level improvements.

DELIVERABLES:
1) Mobile layout audit findings (in code comments + docs/mobile-audit.md).
2) Updated responsive container system.
3) Consistent mobile spacing scale.
4) Safe scroll behavior for headers/content.
5) Improved tap target sizing for interactive elements.
6) No visual regressions on desktop.

PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION:

A) Layout Audit
Audit:
- App shell layout
- Sidebar behavior
- Header height consistency
- Scroll containers
- Forms
- Tables
- Chat layout
- Time tracking UI
- CRM screens
- Admin pages

Create:
docs/mobile-audit.md
with sections:
- Layout issues
- Interaction issues
- Component density issues
- Scroll issues
- Keyboard overlap risks

B) Responsive Container System
Standardize page containers:
- Add a shared PageContainer component if missing.
- Ensure:
  max-w-screen-xl
  px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8
  mx-auto

Ensure every page uses the same container pattern.

C) Spacing Scale Improvements
Audit Tailwind spacing usage and normalize:
- Buttons: min-h-[44px]
- Inputs: min-h-[44px]
- List items: comfortable vertical spacing
- Cards: consistent padding (p-4 mobile, p-6 desktop)

Avoid tiny tap targets.

D) Header + Scroll Safety
Ensure:
- Header does not overlap content on mobile
- Main content scroll container is correct
- Avoid nested scroll containers unless necessary
- Chat view respects viewport height

E) Tables → Mobile-safe behavior
Without redesigning tables:
- ensure overflow-x-auto wrappers exist
- ensure table cells wrap safely on mobile
- avoid layout breaking on small screens

F) Form usability improvements
Ensure:
- labels always visible
- inputs full width on mobile
- spacing between inputs comfortable
- submit buttons easy to tap

G) Verification
Verify:
- Dashboard loads correctly on mobile viewport
- Tasks page usable at 375px width
- Chat usable on mobile viewport
- Time tracking usable on mobile viewport
- CRM pages usable on mobile viewport
- Admin pages usable on mobile viewport

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
When finished, output:
- list of layout files updated
- summary of audit findings
- components standardized
- any mobile risks discovered
