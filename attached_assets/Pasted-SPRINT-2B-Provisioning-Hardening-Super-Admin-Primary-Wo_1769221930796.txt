SPRINT 2B — Provisioning Hardening (Super Admin) + Primary Workspace Rules

CONTEXT:
Super Admin provisions tenants, users, clients, projects, teams. Tenant-wide visibility is expected.
Provisioned entities must always have tenant_id set and should default to the tenant’s primary workspace_id when workspace_id is not specified.

GOAL:
1) Ensure tenant provisioning always sets tenant_id for all created records.
2) Ensure default workspace_id is always the tenant’s PRIMARY workspace.
3) Eliminate schema drift bugs (routes inserting fields not present in Drizzle schema).

ABSOLUTE SAFETY RULES:
- Do NOT change endpoint paths or success response shapes.
- Do NOT remove any existing provisioning features.
- Only additive schema changes allowed (if a field truly needed, add migration + schema update; otherwise remove from insert).
- Do NOT change tenant-wide list behavior.

TASKS:
1) Implement or confirm helper:
- getPrimaryWorkspaceId(tenantId): returns the primary workspace for tenant.
If no primary workspace exists, fail with explicit error and log requestId.

2) In super admin provisioning flows:
- When creating a client/project/team/task without workspace_id:
  set workspace_id = getPrimaryWorkspaceId(tenantId)
- Always set tenant_id = tenantId for all created records.

3) Add provisioning audit logging:
- For each created entity (tenant, workspace, client, project, team, user):
  log: requestId, tenantId, entityType, entityId, workspaceId used.

4) Fix schema drift:
- Search for inserts/updates referencing columns not defined in shared/schema.ts.
- If the UI requires the field and it’s legitimate, add it:
  - Create migration
  - Update Drizzle schema
  - Update create/update validation (zod)
- If the field is legacy/unnecessary, remove it from the insert payload.

5) Add tests:
- Create tenant -> auto-create primary workspace named after tenant
- Provision client + project during onboarding
- Login as tenant admin and confirm client + project visible via existing endpoints

ACCEPTANCE:
- Super Admin can provision tenant and tenant users can see all provisioned clients/projects.
- No tenant-owned entity created with tenant_id NULL.
- No provisioning inserts referencing non-existent columns.
