BUG:
@mentions are still not working in:
1) Task comments
2) Task descriptions

Goal is to fix both end-to-end:
- mention dropdown shows correct users
- selecting a mention inserts a stable token/metadata
- saving content persists mentions correctly
- mentioned users receive notification(s)
- mentions render correctly (optional but ideal)

NON-DESTRUCTIVE RULES:
- Do NOT change API URLs.
- Do NOT change DB schema.
- Do NOT change auth/session/tenant semantics.
- Preserve existing comment/task response shapes (some endpoints use skipEnvelope).
- Prefer reuse of existing services/helpers rather than inventing a second mentions system.

DELIVERABLES:
A) Root cause analysis (exact failure point(s)) written to:
   docs/review/mentions-root-cause.md
B) Fix implemented for:
   - task comment mentions
   - task description mentions
C) Tests:
   - backend integration tests >= 6
   - socket tests only if mention delivery is socket-driven and harness exists
D) Instrumentation:
   - requestId-aware logs for mention extraction + notification fanout (debug-level)
E) Documentation update:
   - short entry in docs/mobile-audit.md (and/or Docs Library) describing mention format + surfaces supported

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — FAST REPRO + TRACE (MUST DO FIRST)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Identify the exact editor input used in:
- Task comment composer
- Task description editor
(plain textarea? TipTap? Lexical? Quill? custom mentions component?)

2) Add TEMP debug logging (dev-only) to capture outgoing payloads:
- When submitting a task comment
- When saving a task description
Log:
- the text/html content being sent
- any mentions metadata array being sent (e.g. mentionedUserIds)
- the entity id(s), tenantId/workspaceId if available

3) Identify the backend handlers called for each:
- comment create endpoint used by tasks
- task update/create endpoint used by description save

Record the request payload shapes and which endpoint receives them in docs/review/mentions-root-cause.md.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — INVENTORY EXISTING MENTIONS INFRA
------------------------------------------------------------

Search the repo for:
- extractMentions
- parseMentions
- mentionUserIds
- MENTION
- notifyMentions
- "typing" is irrelevant; focus on mention extraction + notifications

Find/confirm:
A) One canonical mention extraction helper (or create ONE if missing):
   server/services/mentions/extractMentionUserIds.ts
B) One canonical “mention notification” function:
   server/services/mentions/notifyMentionedUsers.ts
C) Existing DB tables/fields that support mentions (if any):
   - comment_mentions
   - message_mentions
   - notifications with type=mention
   - reads/mentions join tables

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT implement two systems.
Pick or create one canonical pipeline and route both comments and descriptions through it.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — DEFINE A STABLE MENTION FORMAT (FRONTEND ↔ BACKEND CONTRACT)
------------------------------------------------------------

We need a reliable contract. Support these in order of preference:

1) If frontend already produces explicit metadata:
   payload.mentionedUserIds: string[]
   => BACKEND uses this and does NOT rely on brittle text parsing.

2) If editor inserts tokenized text:
   e.g. @[Display Name](userId) OR <span data-mention-id="userId">@Name</span>
   => BACKEND parses tokens to userIds safely.

3) If only plain "@username" exists:
   => BACKEND maps username->userId tenant-scoped (least reliable; only keep for backward compatibility).

Decide what is ACTUALLY being sent today (from Phase 0 logs).
Update both sides so at least (1) or (2) is true for task comments + task descriptions.

Write the chosen contract to docs/review/mentions-root-cause.md.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — FIX TASK COMMENT MENTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

Backend:
1) Locate the task comment create handler/service.
2) Ensure the mention pipeline is invoked on comment creation:
- extract mentioned userIds using canonical helper
- enforce tenant/workspace membership rules
- prevent self-mentions
- dedupe userIds
3) Persist mention records if existing tables are present (optional but preferred).
4) Trigger notifications:
- create notification rows (mention type)
- emit socket notifications if system does that
- send email only if that is existing behavior

Frontend:
5) Ensure comment composer:
- displays mention dropdown
- inserts stable token/metadata
- includes mentionedUserIds (or tokens) in payload on submit

Cache:
6) Ensure comment list updates without refresh (setQueryData + invalidateQueries).

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — FIX TASK DESCRIPTION MENTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

Backend:
1) Locate task create/update handlers that save description.
2) Ensure mention extraction runs on description create/update:
- extract mentions (from payload metadata or token parsing)
- apply same rules (tenant membership, no self, dedupe)
3) Trigger mention notifications for newly-added mentions:
- IMPORTANT: do not
