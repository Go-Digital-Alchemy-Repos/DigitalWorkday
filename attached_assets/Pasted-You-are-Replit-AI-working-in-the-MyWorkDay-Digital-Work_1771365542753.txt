GOAL:
Chat Premium Upgrade (C3) — Make chat feel less boring and easier on mobile.

Constraints:
- UI-only changes (no backend changes).
- Preserve desktop behavior.
- Do not break existing chat scroll/keyboard work from Phase 3B.

DELIVERABLES:
1) Mobile chat list upgrades
2) Conversation UI upgrades (bubbles, grouping, timestamps)
3) Better “at a glance” state (unread, typing, seen)
4) Quick actions that reduce friction (without adding features that need backend)
5) Docs update + verification checklist

MOBILE CHAT LIST IMPROVEMENTS
A) Conversation row readability:
- larger tap target (>=44px)
- clearer unread state (dot or badge)
- show last message preview with truncation
- show timestamp right-aligned
- show subtle typing indicator preview in list when active typing exists

B) Search UX:
- ensure search input is easy to use on mobile
- debounce search (150–250ms)
- loading/empty states

CONVERSATION UI IMPROVEMENTS
C) Message bubble design:
- clear inbound/outbound contrast (use existing theme tokens)
- max width for readability
- break-words
- link styling
- emoji sizing doesn’t explode layout

D) Grouping:
- group consecutive messages by sender
- reduce repeated avatars/names
- show timestamp separators intelligently (time gap)

E) Read/typing integration:
- typing indicator stays stable (reserved area)
- “Seen” (from C2) displays subtly on mobile for DMs

F) Interaction polish:
- long-press on message opens actions sheet (copy text, maybe delete if permitted)
  - If delete/edit already exist, wire them.
  - If not, only implement Copy Text (safe).
- Add a small “scroll to bottom” / “jump to latest” button polish:
  - nicer placement and animation
  - do not cover composer

DOC
G) Update docs/mobile-audit.md:
“Chat Premium C3 — Mobile Polish”
- what changed
- verification checklist

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- files modified
- what was done to reduce “boring/hard to use”
- any follow-ups recommended
