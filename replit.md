# MyWorkDay - Project Management Application

## Overview
MyWorkDay is an Asana-inspired project management application centralizing project and client management to streamline workflows and enhance team collaboration. It offers features like workspaces, tasks, subtasks, tags, comments, activity tracking, and robust reporting. The application supports multi-tenancy, comprehensive CRM with a client portal, and workload management, aiming to improve productivity and client satisfaction through an intuitive user experience.

## User Preferences
- Professional, clean Asana-like design
- Board view as primary view with list view and calendar view options
- **Database migrations**: When pushing schema changes, preserve existing data - only update schema structure, never wipe the database. Use Drizzle migrations (`drizzle-kit generate` + `drizzle-kit migrate`) instead of `drizzle-kit push` for production deployments.
- Calendar view displays tasks with due dates using FullCalendar, with filtering by client/project/assignee/scope; read-only visualization with task detail drawer on click. Uses lightweight CalendarTask DTO (id, title, status, priority, dueDate, projectId, assignees) for performance - full task data fetched on demand when clicked.
- My Tasks view with two viewing modes: date-based grouping (overdue, today, tomorrow, upcoming) and personal sections organization
- Projects Dashboard with search, status/client/team filters, table view showing project details via drawer, and budget utilization indicators
- Workload Reports in Settings showing task distribution by employee with completion metrics
- Workload Forecast with task time estimates, project budgets, budget tracking, and workload distribution by assignee
- **Global Branding**: Login page and app apply system-level branding configured in Super Admin > System Settings > Global Branding. Resolution chain: tenant settings (logo, favicon, primaryColor, appName) → `system_settings` defaults (`defaultLogoUrl`, `defaultFaviconUrl`, `defaultPrimaryColor`, `defaultAppName`) → hardcoded fallback. Login page applies favicon + primary color CSS variable immediately on load (unauthenticated). Authenticated users via `useTenantTheme()` hook — applies primary color without requiring `whiteLabelEnabled`; secondary/accent colors still gated by `whiteLabelEnabled`. `GET /api/v1/auth/login-branding` and `GET /api/v1/tenant/branding` both merge system + tenant layers.
- **Theme Packs**: 14 curated color schemes (light, dark, midnight, graphite, forest, ocean, violet, rose, amber, slate, sand, arctic, espresso, cyber). Accessible via the sun/moon toggle in the header and the Appearance card in User Profile. Stored in `themePackId` column of `user_ui_preferences` table; `themeMode` kept as legacy-safe "light"/"dark"/"system". Tenant default via `defaultThemePack` in `tenant_settings`. Resolution chain: `themePackId ?? themeMode ?? tenantDefaultThemePack ?? "light"`. Unknown pack IDs safely fall back to "light". Theme packs are defined in `client/src/theme/themePacks.ts`, applied via `ThemeProvider` CSS custom properties.
- **Employee Intelligence Profile**: Drill-down report page at `/reports/employees/:employeeId`, accessible by clicking any employee name in the Employee Command Center (all tabs: Overview, Workload, Time, Capacity, Risk, Performance Index, Forecasts). Feature-flagged (`enableEmployeeProfileReport`, default true). Backend aggregator at `server/reports/employeeProfileAggregator.ts` runs all metric sub-queries in parallel via `Promise.all` (employee info, workload, time, capacity, risk, EPI, task breakdown by status/priority/project, weekly trends) — reuses SQL patterns from `server/http/domains/reports-v2-employee.router.ts`, tenant-scoped, archived data excluded. API: `GET /api/reports/v2/employee/:employeeId/profile?range=Xd`. Frontend page `client/src/pages/employee-profile-report.tsx` has date range selector (7d/30d/90d), header card (Avatar, Name, Role, Team, Performance Tier badge, Risk badge), summary metrics grid, workload/time/capacity/risk/trend sections. Extensible for future export, PDF, and performance review integrations.
- **Employee AI Summary**: AI-generated performance trend narrative card on the Employee Intelligence Profile page. Feature-flagged (`enableAiEmployeeSummary`, `enableAiSummaryCache`, `enableAiSummaryRedaction` — all default true). Grounded strictly in aggregated metrics (no task titles, no client names, no message content). Architecture: `server/ai/employeeSummary/buildEmployeeSummaryPayload.ts` maps aggregator output to a safe, structured JSON payload; `server/ai/employeeSummary/generateEmployeeSummary.ts` calls the tenant's configured AI provider (hierarchical: tenant integration → system integration → env var) with structured output enforcing `{ headline, wins, risks, notableChanges, recommendedActions, confidence, supportingMetrics, markdown }`. Caching: 24-hour TTL rows in `ai_summaries` table (PostgreSQL) keyed by `(tenantId, entityType, entityId, rangeStart, rangeEnd)`; stable deep-sorted hash (`inputHash`) detects stale data. Rate limits: in-memory 30/day per tenant, 10/day per user. Redaction: optional second-pass regeneration if email patterns detected. APIs: `GET /api/v1/ai/employee/:id/summary?days=N` (cache-first) and `POST /api/v1/ai/employee/:id/summary/refresh` (force regenerate). Frontend `AiSummaryCard` component in `employee-profile-report.tsx`: loading skeleton, structured error states (AI not configured / rate limited / generic), wins/risks/changes/actions sections, confidence badge, copy-to-clipboard, inline "What is this based on?" dialog, expandable supporting metrics footer, cached indicator.
- **Sticky Chat Composer Focus**: After sending a message, keyboard focus is automatically restored to the chat input textarea across all chat surfaces. Implemented via `useStickyComposerFocus(ref)` hook (`client/src/hooks/useStickyComposerFocus.ts`): captures `hadFocus` state before send, schedules rAF-based refocus on success, and provides IME/composition-safe `isSendKey(e)` guard (blocks Enter during CJK/Korean/Japanese composition). `compositionHandlers` (onCompositionStart/End) spread onto all textarea elements. Applied to: `global-chat-drawer.tsx`, `chat.tsx` (main chat page via `ChatMessageInput`), `features/chat/ThreadPanel.tsx` (thread replies), and `client-portal-messages.tsx` (client portal conversation replies).
- **Mobile & Responsiveness**: App-wide mobile-first responsive patterns. Key standards: (1) **Tables** — all `<Table>` elements are wrapped in `<div className="overflow-x-auto">` to prevent horizontal overflow; wide tables include a mobile hint "Scroll to see all columns"; (2) **Tab navigation** — tab strips on mobile (< 768px) collapse into a `<Select>` dropdown via `MobileTabSelect` component (`client/src/components/reports/mobile-tab-select.tsx`) using CSS-only `md:hidden` / `hidden md:block` pattern — no JS breakpoint detection needed. Pages with many tabs (Account, Settings, Super Admin) use this pattern or horizontally scrollable tab strips (`overflow-x-auto` wrapper with `inline-flex` + `whitespace-nowrap` tabs, shortened labels on small screens); (3) **Command Centers** — Employee CC and Client CC Overview tables show a mobile card view (`md:hidden`) alongside the desktop table (`hidden md:block`) for optimal readability on small screens; (4) **Container padding** — responsive `p-3 sm:p-4 lg:p-6` throughout all pages (account, settings, templates, user-manager, reports, team-detail, employee-profile, super-admin); (5) **Touch targets** — back/action buttons have `min-h-[44px]` on mobile; (6) **Shared utilities** — `useIsMobile` hook at `client/src/hooks/use-is-mobile.ts` (768px threshold, SSR-safe), `MobileTabSelect` component for tab→Select conversion, `ReportCommandCenterLayout` date range selector is `w-full sm:w-44`; (7) **Drawers & Popovers** — Detail drawer uses `w-full sm:max-w-[80vw] sm:min-w-[600px]` (no fixed min-width on mobile); Notification center popover uses `w-[calc(100vw-2rem)] sm:w-[420px]`; Project detail drawer tabs scroll horizontally on mobile; (8) **Page headers** — responsive font sizes `text-xl md:text-2xl`, icon sizes `h-7 w-7 md:h-8 md:w-8`.

- **Data Retention System (Phase 0 + Phase 1)**: Non-destructive soft-archive system for tasks and chat messages. Feature-flagged (`enableDataRetention`, `enableSoftArchive`, `enableRetentionAuditUi` in `server/config.ts`). Schema: `tasks.archivedAt` + `tasks.archivedReason` columns; `dataRetentionPolicies` table (per-tenant, per-entity-type policies with `retentionDays` + `isEnabled`). Query enforcement: all task/chat list endpoints filter `archived_at IS NULL` by default; `?includeArchived=true` param honored only for super users. Daily scheduler (`server/retention/retentionScheduler.ts`) archives eligible records via `runSoftArchive()` (`server/retention/softArchiveRunner.ts`). Audit counts via `getRetentionAuditSummary()` (`server/retention/retentionAudit.ts`). Background job handler `data_retention` registered in job queue. API at `/api/v1/super/retention` (super-admin only): GET audit, GET/POST policies, POST run. Super Admin UI at `/super-admin/retention` — per-tenant audit dashboard + policy config + manual "Run Now" trigger.
